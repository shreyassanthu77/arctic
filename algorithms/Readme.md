## Strings

- Write a function that reverses a string.
- Write a function that determines if a string has repeating characters.
- Write a function that determines if a string is a palindrome.
- Given tow strings, write a function that determines if they are anagrams.


- Write a function that takes a string and a character and returns
    a list of strings split by the character.
    ```python
    # Example
    split_string("Hello, World!", " ")
    # ["Hello,", "World!"]
    ```

- Write a function that takes a string and returns the first non-repeating
    character in the string.
    ```python
    # Example
    first_non_repeating("aabbccxddeeff")
    # "x"
    ```

- Write a function that takes two strings and checks if the second string
    is a substring of the first string. (Try not to use the built-in functions)
    ```python
    # Example
    is_substring("Hello, World!", "World")
    # True
    ```
- Write a functions that take teo strings and returns all the indeces of
    where the second string occurs in the first string.
    ```python
    # Example
    substr("abbabab", "ab")
    # [0, 3, 5]
    ```

- Write a function that takes a list of strings and finds the longest
    common prefix.
    ```python
    # Example
    longest_common_prefix(["flower", "flow", "flight"])
    # "fl"
    ```
